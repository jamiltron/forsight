+ Update all the functions so Forsight is more functional, instead of using
  global vars, pass those vars around, and use copies of *dictionary* instead
  of (set! *dictionary* ... )

+ Implement missing functions (ROT, IF, THEN, etc.)

+ Make a string function so upper/lower doesn't matter.

+ Implement the whole Block thing (Starting Forth Chap 3)

+ Make overwriting words better (remove the old instance of a word)

+ Implement the return stack (I'm embarrassed this is not done yet)

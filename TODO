+ Update all the functions so Forsight is more functional, instead of using
  global vars, pass those vars around, and use copies of *dictionary* instead
  of (set! *dictionary* ... )

+ Get comparisons working in compile-mode

+ Implement the whole Block thing (Starting Forth Chap 3)

+ Implement the return stack (I'm embarrassed this is not done yet)

FORSIGHT
--------

Forsight is a basic Forth interpreter written in Scheme. This is mostly just a
thought-experiment, but if anyone can use it in any fashion I would love to
know!

Forsight is meant to be run on the command line via your Scheme interpreter.
Since I run Gambit-C, I run it as follows:

> gsi forsight.scm

Your Scheme implementation may vary. I also included the binary generated
by Gambit-C, if you prefer to use that.

The currently implementation only supports basic Forth stack-arithmetic, but I
have a working function-definition method somewhat working. Once I iron out
those details I will add them.

The Scheme implementation this was written in is Gambit-C. The "version" of
Forth I am most closely emulating is the language described in Leo Brodie's
"Starting FORTH" (http://www.forth.com/starting-forth).

If any advanced Schemers, Lispers, Forthers, Interpreter-writers, Code Ninjas,
etc. read this program and have any suggestions I'd love to hear them! Send me
a message through here. Also contact me if you use this, I'd love to hear form
you. Also, feel free to fork and improve, hack, whatever.

The License is describe in the LICENSE file, but the short version is that this
is under the BSD 2-clause, so use it however you want - I'd just like a 
nod somewhere if you decide to redistribute it.

Thank you!
